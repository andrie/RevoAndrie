For quite some time I wished a package existed that would allow me to encrypt passwords so I would not have to worry about accicentally leaking secrets.  G치bor Cs치rdi and I co-authored the `secret` package, to encrypt passwords and other secrets you want to share. The package enables secure sharing of sensitive information in R packages.

I became involved in this project because I wanted to find a way to test the [`AzureML`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=AzureML) package. `AzureML` is an interface between R and the Microsoft [Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://studio.azureml.net/) (Azure ML). To use these tools, you have to log in to Azure using your workspace credentials.  So, to test the package, the test suite also has to log in.  I used to do this by creating a local file (outside the package folder) with my credentials.

This worked fine as long as I worked by myself. However, this made it difficult to collaborate with other peopl on the project, since they would have to replicate a test environment and create their own credentials file.

```

## The code

You can find the package source code at [github](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/secret) and install it directly from [CRAN]()

```r
install.packages("secret")
```


## Introducing the package at UseR!2017

We introduced the `secret` package at UseR!2017, and published this on CRAN only a few weeks earlier, on June 17th.

The talk was very well received. David Smith blogged about it during the conference...

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```


... and then wrote a very nice blog post at [Revolutions](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/07/secret-package.html):

## Watch the video

The entire event, including this presentation, was recorded by Microsoft. You can watch the video at Channel 9:

```

## And the presentation

Here is the presentation:

```


## The demo

During the talk I gave a demo, loosely based on the package vignette:
