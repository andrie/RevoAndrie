<p>For quite some time I wished a package existed that would allow me to encrypt passwords so I would not have to worry about accicentally leaking secrets. Gábor Csárdi and I co-authored the <code>secret</code> package, to encrypt passwords and other secrets you want to share. The package enables secure sharing of sensitive information in R packages.</p>
<p>I became involved in this project because I wanted to find a way to test the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=AzureML"><code>AzureML</code></a> package. <code>AzureML</code> is an interface between R and the Microsoft <a href="https://studio.azureml.net/">Azure Machine Learning Studio</a> (Azure ML). To use these tools, you have to log in to Azure using your workspace credentials. So, to test the package, the test suite also has to log in. I used to do this by creating a local file (outside the package folder) with my credentials.</p>
<p>This worked fine as long as I worked by myself. However, this made it difficult to collaborate with other peopl on the project, since they would have to replicate a test environment and create their own credentials file.</p>

<h2>Introducing the package at UseR!2017</h2>
<p>We introduced the <code>secret</code> package at UseR!2017, and published this on CRAN only a few weeks earlier, on June 17th.</p>
<p>The talk was very well received. David Smith blogged about it during the conference..,</p>
