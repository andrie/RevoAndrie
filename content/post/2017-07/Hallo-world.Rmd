Every person has a different learning style.  I learn best by experimenting and doing, frequently by writing R code.  However, I frequently forget what I've done or how to do it.  And sometimes I just want to share my ideas with others.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("figure",  src = "/images/2017-07/hallo-world.png")
```

My intention with this blog is to write down random ideas on a variety of things I work on. So in this blog I will mainly explore the world of R, machine learning and statistics.

## Technical side note

I am using the excellent [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) R package that renders R markdown to html format. Then the pages gets compiled by the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) blog system into web pages.  After some experimentation I chose the [`tranquilpeak` theme](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme).
