Every person has a different learning style.  I learn best by experimenting and doing, frequently by writing R code.  However, I frequently forget what I've done or how to do it.  And sometimes I just want to share my ideas with others.

My intention with this blog is to write down random ideas on a variety of things I work on. So in this blog I will mainly explore the world of R, machine learning and statistics.

## Technical side note

I am using the excellent `blogdown` R package that renders R markdown to html format. Then the pages gets compiled by the Hugo blog system into web pages.  After some experimentation I chose the `tranquilpeak` theme.
