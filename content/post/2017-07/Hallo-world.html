<p>Every person has a different learning style. I learn best by experimenting and doing, frequently by writing R code. However, I frequently forget what Iâ€™ve done or how to do it. And sometimes I just want to share my ideas with others.</p>

<p>My intention with this blog is to write down random ideas on a variety of things I work on. So in this blog I will mainly explore the world of R, machine learning and statistics.</p>

<h2>Technical side note</h2>
<p>I am using the excellent <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"><code>blogdown</code></a> R package that renders R markdown to html format. Then the pages gets compiled by the <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> blog system into web pages. After some experimentation I chose the <a href="https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme"><code>tranquilpeak</code> theme</a>.</p>
