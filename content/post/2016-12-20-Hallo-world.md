Every person has a different learning style.  I learn best by experimenting and doing, frequently by writing R code.  However, I frequently forget what I've done or how to do it.  And sometimes I just want to share my ideas with others.

My intention with this blog is to write down random ideas on a variety of things I work on.

So in this blog I will mainly explore the world of R, machine learning and statistics.
