I have many ideas and explore some of them.  But my memory is short, so I tend to forget what I've done or how to do it.

My intention with this blog is to write down random ideas on a variety of things I work on.

So in this blog I will explore the world of R, machine learning and advanced analytics on Azure Cortana Intelligence Suite (CIS).  But expect to get random ideas on Python, software development and other topics.
