      <description>Every person has a different learning style. I learn best by experimenting and doing, frequently by writing R code. However, I frequently forget what I&amp;rsquo;ve done or how to do it. And sometimes I just want to share my ideas with others.
My intention with this blog is to write down random ideas on a variety of things I work on.
So in this blog I will mainly explore the world of R, machine learning and statistics.</description>
